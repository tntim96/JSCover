<h2>JSCover</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/tntim96/JSCover" target="_blank">JSCover</a> is a tool that measures code coverage for JavaScript programs.
    It is an enhanced Java implementation of the excellent
    <a href="http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/" target="_blank">JSCoverage</a> tool.
    See the file-based version in action now using the
    <a href="example-qunit/out/jscoverage.html?test/index.html" target="_blank">QUnit test suite</a>.
    See the server-based report now for

<h2>JSCover has added branch coverage!</h2>

<p>
    Release 0.1.0-RC1 has added the branch coverage capability - see the manual for details.
    All documentation and examples have been updated.

<h2>Why choose JSCover</h2>

<p>
    Reasons that you might choose to use JSCover are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You need coverage measured via a browser (e.g. your tests include DOM interaction)</li>
    <li>
        You need coverage measured in headless mode (see
        <a href="https://github.com/tntim96/JSCover/blob/master/src/test-acceptance/java/jscover/server/HtmlUnitServerTest.java" target="_blank">HtmlUnitServerTest</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/tntim96/JSCover/blob/master/src/test-acceptance/java/jscover/filesystem/HtmlUnitFileSystemTest.java" target="_blank">HtmlUnitFileSystemTest</a>)
    </li>
    <li>JSCover will run anywhere Java does (NB: JSCoverage may not run on all your platforms)</li>
    <li>You need to collate coverage results from multiple independent tests.</li>
    <li>You need a report stored on the file-system (multiple report formats supported including LCOV)</li>
    <li>Quick and easy to set-up</li>
    <li>JSCover is under active development</li>
    <li>
        JSCover is architecturally simple and modular, and so should be easy to
        contribute to and maintain, hopefully ensuring a long life-time.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you find a bug please
    <a href="https://github.com/tntim96/JSCover/issues" target="_blank">report it</a>
    and we'll endeavour to correct it.
    Alternatively, you can try
    <a href="http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/" target="_blank">JSCoverage</a>
    (N.B. JSCoverage does not support branch coverage).
</p>

<p>
    If running as part of a test suite, the test suite should be run a second time without instrumentation to
    ensure consistent behaviour.
